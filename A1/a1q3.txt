def heuristic(goalState,currentState):
      return abs(goalState - currentState)

My heuristic finds the difference between the goal state and the current state so
that the states can be sorted based on how far apart they are. The relaxed
problem my heuristic comes from is simplifying the original problem to only have
addition and subtraction. In that problem the closer to the goal state the better.

Example:
goalState = 20, currentState = 10
hueristic(goalState,currentState) = 10

goalState = 40, currentState = 55
heuristic(goalState,currentState) = 15

I don't think the given heuristic is admissible because it is possible to
overestimate the path cost.
